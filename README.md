The purpose of this app is to help investors track portfolios of stocks.

An investor can create multiple portfolios of stocks.  For each portfolio the investor can provide a date range and see how the portfolio performed over that time period.

An investor can edit a portfolio by adjusting the number of shares of each stock within the portfolio, removing/adding stocks, or just deleting the entire portfolio.
